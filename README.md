# Andover Astronomers APOD app
This is a front end web application that consumes the NASA APOD api and supplies it to members of the Andover Astronomers club in Andover, CT. Users can select a date and recieve pictures and their description from NASA's database.  Right now this is mainly used for club meetings to spark discussions on latest astronomy findings, or to provide inspiration of things to look for while stargazing.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (all vanilla)

This app uses Vanilla Javascript to consume the NASA APOD API and presents it with Vanilla HTML and CSS. Users are able to select different dates in order to get images from specific dates. 

## Optimizations

I would love to add some social media API's to allow users to post their fav pics with a quick description. The mobile layouts and main layouts could also use some touching up. I would also like to eventually apply a framework to be able to share my JS code without comprimising my API key.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this application was great practice for consuming an API that required authorization, and also manipulating the data recieved from the API using user input. I gained a better grasp on event listeners, and how to pass data to html views.
